<div class="note">
<p><br />Nearly the whole of this volume is a reprint of the serious portion of
<i>Phantasmagoria and other Poems</i>, which was first published in 1869 and
has long been out of print. &#8220;The Path of Roses&#8221; was written soon after the
Crimean War, when the name of Florence Nightingale had already become a
household-word. &#8220;Only a Woman&#8217;s Hair&#8221; was suggested by a circumstance
mentioned in <i>The Life of Dean Swift</i>, viz., that, after his death, a
small packet was found among his papers, containing a single lock of hair
and inscribed with those words. &#8220;After Three Days&#8221; was written after
seeing Holman Hunt&#8217;s picture, <i>The Finding of Christ in the Temple</i>.</p>

<p>The two poems, &#8220;Far Away&#8221; and &#8220;A Song of Love&#8221;, are reprinted from <i>Sylvie
and Bruno</i> and <i>Sylvie and Bruno Concluded</i>, books whose high price (made
necessary by the great cost of production) has, I fear, put them out of
the reach of most of my readers. &#8220;A Lesson in Latin&#8221; is reprinted from
<i>The Jabberwock</i>, a Magazine got up among the Members of &#8220;The Girls&#8217; Latin
School, Boston, U.S.A.&#8221; The only poems, here printed for the first time,
are put together under the title of &#8220;Puck Lost and Found,&#8221; having been
inscribed in two books&mdash;<i>Fairies</i>, a poem by Allingham, illustrated by
Miss E. Gertrude Thomson, and <i>Merry Elves</i>, a story-book, by whom written
I do not know, illustrated by C. O. Murray&mdash;which were presented to a
little girl and boy, as a sort of memento of a visit paid by them to the
author one day, on which occasion he taught them the pastime&mdash;dear to the
hearts of children&mdash;of folding paper-&#8220;pistols,&#8221; which can be made to
imitate, fairly well, the noise of a real one.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="table">
<tr><td>He saw her once, and in the glance,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A moment&#8217;s glance of meeting eyes,</span><br />
His heart stood still in sudden trance:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He trembled with a sweet surprise&mdash;</span><br />
All in the waning light she stood,<br />
The star of perfect womanhood.<br />
<br />
That summer-eve his heart was light:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With lighter step he trod the ground:</span><br />
And life was fairer in his sight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And music was in every sound:</span><br />
He blessed the world where there could be<br />
So beautiful a thing as she.<br />
<br />
There once again, as evening fell<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And stars were peering overhead,</span><br />
Two lovers met to bid farewell:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">The western sun gleamed faint and red,</span><br />
Lost in a drift of purple cloud<br />
That wrapped him like a funeral-shroud.<br />
<br />
Long time the memory of that night&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The hand that clasped, the lips that kissed,</span><br />
The form that faded from his sight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Slow sinking through the tearful mist&mdash;</span><br />
In dreamy music seemed to roll<br />
Through the dark chambers of his soul.<br />
<br />
So after many years he came<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A wanderer from a distant shore:</span><br />
The street, the house, were still the same,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But those he sought were there no more:</span><br />
His burning words, his hopes and fears,<br />
Unheeded fell on alien ears.<br />
<br />
Only the children from their play<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would pause the mournful tale to hear,</span><br />
Shrinking in half-alarm away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or, step by step, would venture near</span><br />
To touch with timid curious hands<br />
That strange wild man from other lands.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span><br />
He sat beside the busy street,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There, where he last had seen her face:</span><br />
And thronging memories, bitter-sweet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seemed yet to haunt the ancient place:</span><br />
Her footfall ever floated near:<br />
Her voice was ever in his ear.<br />
<br />
He sometimes, as the daylight waned<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And evening mists began to roll,</span><br />
In half-soliloquy complained<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of that black shadow on his soul,</span><br />
And blindly fanned, with cruel care,<br />
The ashes of a vain despair.<br />
<br />
The summer fled: the lonely man<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Still lingered out the lessening days;</span><br />
Still, as the night drew on, would scan<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each passing face with closer gaze&mdash;</span><br />
Till, sick at heart, he turned away,<br />
And sighed &#8220;she will not come to-day.&#8221;<br />
<br />
So by degrees his spirit bent<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">To mock its own despairing cry,</span><br />
In stern self-torture to invent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">New luxuries of agony,</span><br />
And people all the vacant space<br />
With visions of her perfect face.<br />
<br />
Then for a moment she was nigh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He heard no step, but she was there;</span><br />
As if an angel suddenly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were bodied from the viewless air,</span><br />
And all her fine ethereal frame<br />
Should fade as swiftly as it came.<br />
<br />
So, half in fancy&#8217;s sunny trance,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And half in misery&#8217;s aching void</span><br />
With set and stony countenance<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His bitter being he enjoyed,</span><br />
And thrust for ever from his mind<br />
The happiness he could not find.<br />
<br />
As when the wretch, in lonely room,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To selfish death is madly hurled,</span><br />
The glamour of that fatal fume<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shuts out the wholesome living world&mdash;</span><br />
So all his manhood&#8217;s strength and pride<br />
One sickly dream had swept aside.<br />
<br />
Yea, brother, and we passed him there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But yesterday, in merry mood,</span><br />
And marveled at the lordly air<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That shamed his beggar&#8217;s attitude,</span><br />
Nor heeded that ourselves might be<br />
Wretches as desperate as he;<br />
<br />
Who let the thought of bliss denied<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Make havoc of our life and powers,</span><br />
And pine, in solitary pride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For peace that never shall be ours,</span><br />
Because we will not work and wait<br />
In trustful patience for our fate.<br />
<br />
And so it chanced once more that she<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came by the old familiar spot:</span><br />
The face he would have died to see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bent o&#8217;er him, and he knew it not;</span><br />
Too rapt in selfish grief to hear,<br />
Even when happiness was near.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span><br />
And pity filled her gentle breast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For him that would not stir nor speak</span><br />
The dying crimson of the west,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That faintly tinged his haggard cheek,</span><br />
Fell on her as she stood, and shed<br />
A glory round the patient head.<br />
<br />
Ah, let him wake! The moments fly:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This awful tryst may be the last.</span><br />
And see, the tear, that dimmed her eye,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had fallen on him ere she passed&mdash;</span><br />
She passed: the crimson paled to gray:<br />
And hope departed with the day.<br />
<br />
The heavy hours of night went by,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And silence quickened into sound,</span><br />
And light slid up the eastern sky,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And life began its daily round&mdash;</span><br />
But light and life for him were fled:<br />
His name was numbered with the dead.<br />

<tr><td>In the dark silence of an ancient room,<br />
Whose one tall window fronted to the West,<br />
Where, through laced tendrils of a hanging vine,<br />
The sunset-glow was fading into night,<br />
Sat a pale Lady, resting weary hands<br />
Upon a great clasped volume, and her face<br />
Within her hands. Not as in rest she bowed,<br />
But large hot tears were coursing down her cheek,<br />
And her low-panted sobs broke awefully<br />
Upon the sleeping echoes of the night.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soon she unclasp&#8217;d the volume once again,</span><br />
And read the words in tone of agony,<br />
As in self-torture, weeping as she read:&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span><br />
<i>&#8220;He crowns the glory of his race:<br />
He prayeth but in some fit place<br />
To meet his foeman face to face:<br />
<br />
&#8220;And, battling for the True, the Right,<br />
From ruddy dawn to purple night,<br />
To perish in the midmost fight:<br />
<br />
&#8220;Where hearts are fierce and hands are strong,<br />
Where peals the bugle loud and long,<br />
Where blood is dropping in the throng:<br />
<br />
&#8220;Still, with a dim and glazing eye,<br />
To watch the tide of victory,<br />
To hear in death the battle-cry:<br />
<br />
&#8220;Then, gathered grandly to his grave,<br />
To rest among the true and brave,<br />
In holy ground, where yew-trees wave:<br />
<br />
&#8220;Where, from church-windows sculptured fair,<br />
Float out upon the evening air<br />
The note of praise, the voice of prayer:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span><br />
&#8220;Where no vain marble mockery<br />
Insults with loud and boastful lie<br />
The simple soldier&#8217;s memory:<br />
<br />
&#8220;Where sometimes little children go,<br />
And read, in whisper&#8217;d accent slow,<br />
The name of him who sleeps below.&#8221;</i><br />
<br />
Her voice died out: like one in dreams she sat.<br />
&#8220;Alas!&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;For what can Woman do?<br />
Her life is aimless, and her death unknown:<br />
Hemmed in by social forms she pines in vain.<br />
Man has his work, but what can Woman do?&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And answer came there from the creeping gloom,</span><br />
The creeping gloom that settled into night:<br />
&#8220;Peace! For thy lot is other than a man&#8217;s:<br />
His is a path of thorns: he beats them down:<br />
He faces death: he wrestles with despair.<br />
Thine is of roses, to adorn and cheer<br />
His lonely life, and hide the thorns in flowers.&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She spake again: in bitter tone she spake:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>&#8220;Aye, as a toy, the puppet of an hour,<br />
Or a fair posy, newly plucked at morn,<br />
But flung aside and withered ere the night.&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And answer came there from the creeping gloom,</span><br />
The creeping gloom that blackened into night:<br />
&#8220;So shalt thou be the lamp to light his path,<br />
What time the shades of sorrow close around.&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, so it seemed to her, an awful light</span><br />
Pierced slowly through the darkness, orbed, and grew,<br />
Until all passed away&mdash;the ancient room&mdash;<br />
The sunlight dying through the trellised vine&mdash;<br />
The one tall window&mdash;all had passed away,<br />
And she was standing on the mighty hills.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath, around, and far as eye could see,</span><br />
Squadron on squadron, stretched opposing hosts,<br />
Ranked as for battle, mute and motionless.<br />
Anon a distant thunder shook the ground,<br />
The tramp of horses, and a troop shot by&mdash;<br />
Plunged headlong in that living sea of men&mdash;<br />
Plunged to their death: back from that fatal field<br />
A scattered handful, fighting hard for life,<br />
Broke through the serried lines; but, as she gazed,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>They shrank and melted, and their forms grew thin&mdash;<br />
Grew pale as ghosts when the first morning ray<br />
Dawns from the East&mdash;the trumpet&#8217;s brazen blare<br />
Died into silence&mdash;and the vision passed&mdash;<br />
Passed to a room where sick and dying lay<br />
In long, sad line&mdash;there brooded Fear and Pain&mdash;<br />
Darkness was there, the shade of Azrael&#8217;s wing.<br />
But there was one that ever, to and fro,<br />
Moved with light footfall: purely calm her face,<br />
And those deep steadfast eyes that starred the gloom:<br />
Still, as she went, she ministered to each<br />
Comfort and counsel; cooled the fevered brow<br />
With softest touch, and in the listening ear<br />
Of the pale sufferer whispered words of peace.<br />
The dying warrior, gazing as she passed,<br />
Clasped his thin hands and blessed her. Bless her too,<br />
Thou, who didst bless the merciful of old!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So prayed the Lady, watching tearfully</span><br />
Her gentle moving onward, till the night<br />
Had veiled her wholly, and the vision passed.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then once again the solemn whisper came:</span><br />
&#8220;So in the darkest path of man&#8217;s despair,<br />
Where War and Terror shake the troubled earth,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>Lies woman&#8217;s mission; with unblenching brow<br />
To pass through scenes of horror and affright<br />
Where men grow sick and tremble: unto her<br />
All things are sanctified, for all are good.<br />
Nothing so mean, but shall deserve her care:<br />
Nothing so great, but she may bear her part.<br />
No life is vain: each hath his place assigned:<br />
Do thou thy task, and leave the rest to God.&#8221;<br />
And there was silence, but the Lady made<br />
No answer, save one deeply-breathed &#8220;Amen.&#8221;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And she arose, and in that darkening room</span><br />
Stood lonely as a spirit of the night&mdash;<br />
Stood calm and fearless in the gathered night&mdash;<br />
And raised her eyes to heaven. There were tears<br />
Upon her face, but in her heart was peace,<br />
Peace that the world nor gives nor takes away!<br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span><br />
And now in death my soul is fain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To tell the tale of fear</span><br />
That hidden in my breast hath lain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Through many a weary year:</span><br />
Yet time would fail to utter all&mdash;<br />
The evil spells that held me thrall,<br />
And thrust my life from fall to fall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thou needest not to hear.</span><br />
<br />
The spells that bound me with a chain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sin&#8217;s stern behests to do,</span><br />
Till Pleasure&#8217;s self, invoked in vain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A heavy burden grew&mdash;</span><br />
Till from my spirit&#8217;s fevered eye,<br />
A hunted thing, I seemed to fly<br />
Through the dark woods that underlie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yon mountain-range of blue.</span><br />
<br />
Deep in those woods I found a vale<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No sunlight visiteth,</span><br />
Nor star, nor wandering moonbeam pale;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where never comes the breath</span><br />
Of summer-breeze&mdash;there in mine ear,<br />
Even as I lingered half in fear,<br />
I heard a whisper, cold and clear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&#8220;This is the gate of Death.</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;O bitter is it to abide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In weariness alway:</span><br />
At dawn to sigh for eventide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">At eventide for day.</span><br />
Thy noon hath fled: thy sun hath shone.<br />
The brightness of thy day is gone:<br />
What need to lag and linger on<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Till life be cold and gray?</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;O well,&#8221; it said, &#8220;beneath yon pool,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In some still cavern deep,</span><br />
The fevered brain might slumber cool,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The eyes forget to weep:</span><br />
Within that goblet&#8217;s mystic rim<br />
Are draughts of healing, stored for him<br />
Whose heart is sick, whose sight is dim,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who prayeth but to sleep!&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span><br />
The evening-breeze went moaning by,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like mourner for the dead,</span><br />
And stirred, with shrill complaining sigh,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The tree-tops overhead:</span><br />
My guardian-angel seemed to stand<br />
And mutely wave a warning hand&mdash;<br />
With sudden terror all unmanned,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I turned myself and fled!</span><br />
<br />
A cottage-gate stood open wide:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Soft fell the dying ray</span><br />
On two fair children, side by side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That rested from their play&mdash;</span><br />
Together bent the earnest head,<br />
As ever and anon they read<br />
From one dear Book: the words they said<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Come back to me to-day.</span><br />
<br />
Like twin cascades on mountain-stair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Together wandered down</span><br />
The ripples of the golden hair,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 2em;">The ripples of the brown:</span><br />
While, through the tangled silken haze,<br />
Blue eyes looked forth in eager gaze,<br />
More starlike than the gems that blaze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">About a monarch&#8217;s crown.</span><br />
<br />
My son, there comes to each an hour<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When sinks the spirit&#8217;s pride&mdash;</span><br />
When weary hands forget their power<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The strokes of death to guide:</span><br />
In such a moment, warriors say,<br />
A word the panic-rout may stay,<br />
A sudden charge redeem the day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And turn the living tide.</span><br />
<br />
I could not see, for blinding tears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The glories of the west:</span><br />
A heavenly music filled mine ears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A heavenly peace my breast.</span><br />
&#8220;Come unto Me, come unto Me&mdash;<br />
All ye that labour, unto Me&mdash;<br />
Ye heavy-laden, come to Me&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And I will give you rest.&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span><br />
The night drew onward: thin and blue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The evening mists arise</span><br />
To bathe the thirsty land in dew,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As erst in Paradise&mdash;</span><br />
While, over silent field and town,<br />
The deep blue vault of heaven looked down;<br />
Not, as of old, in angry frown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But bright with angels&#8217; eyes.</span><br />
<br />
Blest day! Then first I heard the voice<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That since hath oft beguiled</span><br />
These eyes from tears, and bid rejoice<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">This heart with anguish wild&mdash;</span><br />
Thy mother, boy, thou hast not known;<br />
So soon she left me here to moan&mdash;<br />
Left me to weep and watch, alone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Our one beloved child.</span><br />
<br />
Though, parted from my aching sight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like homeward-speeding dove,</span><br />
She passed into the perfect light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That floods the world above;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>Yet our twin spirits, well I know&mdash;<br />
Though one abide in pain below&mdash;<br />
Love, as in summers long ago,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And evermore shall love.</span><br />
<br />
So with a glad and patient heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I move toward mine end:</span><br />
The streams, that flow awhile apart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Shall both in ocean blend.</span><br />
I dare not weep: I can but bless<br />
The Love that pitied my distress,<br />
And lent me, in Life&#8217;s wilderness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So sweet and true a friend.</span><br />
<br />
But if there be&mdash;O if there be<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A truth in what they say,</span><br />
That angel-forms we cannot see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Go with us on our way;</span><br />
Then surely she is with me here,<br />
I dimly feel her spirit near&mdash;<br />
The morning-mists grow thin and clear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And Death brings in the Day.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I could not choose but stay:</span><br />

&#8220;Drink of the juice, Sir Knight,&#8221; she said:<br />

Pleasant the secret hoard of bread:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">What bars us from our pleasure?&#8221;</span><br />
<br />
&#8220;Yea, take we pleasure while we may,&#8221;<br />

In the red sunset, far away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">My happier life was dying:</span><br />
My heart was sad, my voice was gay.<br />
<br />
And unawares, I knew not how,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I kissed her dainty finger-tips,</span><br />
I kissed her on the lily brow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I kissed her on the false, false lips&mdash;</span><br />

<br />
&#8220;True love gives true love of the best:<br />

The very heart from out my breast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I plucked, I gave it willingly:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her very heart she gave to me&mdash;</span><br />
Then died the glory from the west.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span><br />

The flowers were fading in their place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were fading with the fading day.</span><br />
<br />
Forth from her, like a hunted deer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through all that ghastly night I fled,</span><br />
And still behind me seemed to hear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Her fierce unflagging tread;</span><br />
And scarce drew breath for fear.<br />
<br />
Yet marked I well how strangely seemed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The heart within my breast to sleep:</span><br />
Silent it lay, or so I dreamed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">With never a throb or leap.</span><br />
<br />
For hers was now my heart, she said,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The heart that once had been mine own:</span><br />
And in my breast I bore instead<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">A cold, cold heart of stone.</span><br />

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span><br />
The sun shot downward through the trees<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">His old familiar flame:</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">From copse and meadow came&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But I was not the same.</span><br />

Yea, when one&#8217;s heart is laid asleep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">What better than to die?</span><br />
So that the grave be dark and deep.<br />
<br />
To die! To die? And yet, methinks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I drink of life, to-day,</span><br />
Deep as the thirsty traveler drinks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of fountain by the way:</span><br />
My voice is sad, my heart is gay.<br />
<br />
When yestereve was on the wane,<br />

<br />
Then call me what they will, I know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That now my soul is glad:</span><br />
If this be madness, better so,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Far better to be mad,</span><br />
Weeping or smiling as I go.<br />
<br />
For if I weep, it is that now<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I see how deep a loss is mine,</span><br />
And feel how brightly round my brow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The coronal might shine,</span><br />
Had I but kept mine early vow:<br />
<br />
And if I smile, it is that now<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I see the promise of the years&mdash;</span><br />
The garland waiting for my brow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That must be won with tears,</span><br />
With pain&mdash;with death&mdash;I care not how.<br />

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
